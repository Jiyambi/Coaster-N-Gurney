Core Idea: The core purpose of "Coaster 'N Gurney" is to "Make Shooting Enemies Fun".

The player needs to feel compelled to shoot enemies by making the gameplay Visceral and Enjoyable. This can be accomplished in a number of ways:


Gun Recoil: The gun has a recoil animation for when it fires a weapon. This gives a sense of weight to the weapon, thus making the bullet seem more powerful and dangerous.

Rumble Screen: When an enemy explodes (especially the screen-white-out explosion of bosses) the screen shakes, instilling the enemy's death with a visual, visceral and violently victorious feedback.

Musical Combo: When enemies come in a special pack, taking them out one after another begins a musical chain of chimes which increases in scale(?) as each enemy dies, finishing with fireworks and bonus points/ammunition/weapons. Could be a minor goal of the player during combat. Wouldn't work with AoE weapons.
